                    Entry level front end developer. I have obtained a certificate in full stack web development from the University of Pennsylvania.
                    This program taught skills in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Firebase, Node.JS, MySQL, MongoDB, Express, Handlebars,
                    and React. I am looking to further the skills I have obtained in the program through a career as a front end developer. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through the certificate program I had the pleasure of collabortating on projects in a group setting. Due to the Coronavirus pandemic
                    our groups were forced to work together virtually. I feel that this experience helped sharpen my skills, as we were not always able to
                    discuss and resolve issues together, which added a level of responsibility to each individual. Through this I was able to gain good experience
                    collabortating with a group remotely using Github. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Prior to obtaining a certificate in full stack web development I graduated from Temple University (Class of 2016) with a Bachelor's Degree in Criminal Justice
                    and a minor in Sociology. From June 2016 to June of 2020 I worked as a claims specialist for First American Title Insurance Company.
                    My time in that position helped me develop my attention to detail, as well as my ability to work on multiple files at a time and work under strict deadlines.
                    I believe that the knowledge and skills I learned through the University of Pennsylvania's certificate program, coupled with the skills and 
                    experience I gained through previous employment, will help me be a valuable asset as a front end developer.
